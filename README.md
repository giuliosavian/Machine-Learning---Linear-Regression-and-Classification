## Intro Of The Project
This project has been made by myself from the machine learning course in the university of Padua.

In this notebook we are going to explore the use of Linear Regression on a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) data

We are going to touch: 
1. Split data in training, validation and test sets
2. Data Normalization
3. Model Training 
4. Data prediction 
5. Confidence intervals for output predictions

In this notebook we are going to explore the use of Linear Classification on Wine Dataset

We are going to touch: 
1. Perceptron
2. Split data in training, validation, test and Model Training 
3. Logistic Regression

<!-- Get started -->
## Get Started

For start:
1. Download and install python kernel
2. Download and install anaconda with jupyter notebook or vsc with jupyter extension or google colab
3. Install the libraries: __future__, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy
4. Run the code and start learning
